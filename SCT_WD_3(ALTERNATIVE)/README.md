Customization

    Add More Questions: Expand the quizQuestions array in script.js with more questions, options, and correct answers.

    Question Types: For "Fill in the Blanks" or "Multi-Select", you would need to modify index.html to include different input types (e.g., text input for fill-in-the-blanks, checkboxes for multi-select) and update script.js logic to handle these new input types and their scoring.

    Visuals: Experiment with style.css to change button colors, option styles, and overall theme.

    Feedback: Implement immediate feedback (e.g., green/red border on option selection) in selectAnswer function.

    Social Links: Update the href attributes in the footer section of index.html with your actual social media profiles.
